## Brand Voice and Tone
The desired brand voice and tone for CouponCupid are **Friendly & Approachable**. This means we aim for a communication style that is:

*   **Warm and Welcoming:** Users should feel a sense of comfort and ease when interacting with the app and its content.
*   **Helpful and Supportive:** The language used should guide users clearly and offer assistance without being condescending or overly technical.
*   **Easy to Understand:** Information should be presented in a simple, straightforward manner, avoiding jargon or complex phrasing to ensure accessibility for all users.

This approach ensures that CouponCupid feels like a trusted companion in the grocery shopping journey, making users feel comfortable and supported in their efforts to save money.
