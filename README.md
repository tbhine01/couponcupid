## ðŸš€ CouponCupid is Live!

A couple of things to note as you explore the app:

1. **Price Accuracy**
   - The prices displayed are **no longer accurate**.
   - Kroger has removed price information from their public API. The prices shown are **randomly generated** to simulate the full API experience.

2. **Publix Support**
   - The **Publix option is not functional**.
   - Publix does not provide a public API. The prices shown for Publix are based on Kroger's data and are not accurate.

3. **Product Availability**
   - Some items may appear as **unavailable**.
   - This occurs because Kroger's API does not return products for certain categories. When this happens, a pop-up will inform you.
